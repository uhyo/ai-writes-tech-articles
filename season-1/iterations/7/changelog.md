# Changelog - Iteration 7

## Summary

**CRITICAL PLATEAU IDENTIFIED:** Iterations 6 and 7 both scored 8.0/10 with the same fundamental issue: **guidelines are being followed mechanically rather than organically**. This represents a qualitative shift from previous iterations where we added more techniques. Now, the problem is HOW those techniques are being applied.

This update marks a **paradigm shift** from prescriptive rules to meta-cognitive guidance. Instead of telling the Writer WHAT to do, we're now emphasizing HOW to think.

## The Core Problem

The review revealed that Iteration 7's article, while technically implementing all the techniques (trial-and-error ✅, reader dialogue ✅, anecdotes ✅), felt like "following a formula" rather than authentic human writing. The techniques worked individually but felt mechanical when combined.

**Key insight:** Guidelines describe OUTCOMES of human thinking, not INPUTS to article generation.

### What This Means

❌ **Old approach (mechanical):**
- "I need to add reader dialogue" → Insert "お察しの通り"
- "I need trial-and-error" → Create V1→V2→V3 structure
- "I need an anecdote" → Write about a project

✅ **New approach (organic):**
- Think deeply about the concept → Realize it evolved through problems → Show that evolution
- Notice readers might misunderstand → Address confusion in that moment
- Remember genuine discovery → Let it inform the explanation

## Major Changes

### 1. Added Section 5.1: "Write from THINKING, Not from FORMULA" [NEW]

**Lines added:** ~20 lines
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - This is now the FIRST thing in the IMPORTANT section

**What changed:**
Created entirely new meta-cognitive guidance explaining that techniques are SYMPTOMS of thinking, not TOOLS to apply.

**Why this matters:**
This addresses the root cause of the plateau. The Writer has learned all the techniques but is applying them like a checklist rather than letting them emerge naturally from genuine thought processes.

**Example guidance:**
- "DON'T follow writing guidelines mechanically"
- "Techniques are SYMPTOMS of thinking, not TOOLS to apply"
- Explicit contrast between formula-following and thinking-driven approaches

### 2. Added Section 5.3: "Introduce Conceptual Frameworks" [NEW]

**Lines added:** ~18 lines
**Priority:** 🟡 IMPORTANT

**What changed:**
New guidance on creating meta-technical concepts that REFRAME discussions, not just explain them.

**Why this matters:**
Human articles (especially uhyo's) introduce higher-level abstractions:
- "Promiseが一級市民ではなかった" (not in official docs)
- "記憶領域を必要としないフック" (creates new mental category)
- "レンダリング単位の記憶領域" vs "コンポーネント単位の記憶領域"

These show deep thinking beyond surface-level reporting.

**How to create frameworks:**
1. Notice a recurring pattern or constraint
2. Give it a name that's not in official docs
3. Use it to explain why things work the way they do
4. Reference it later for conceptual continuity

### 3. Restructured Section 5.5: "Structure: Non-Linear Exploration" [MAJOR REVISION]

**Lines removed:** ~20 lines (old "Structure & Organization")
**Lines added:** ~16 lines (new "Non-Linear Exploration")
**Net change:** -4 lines

**What changed:**
Completely reframed from "how to organize sections" to "how to explore messily."

**Old focus:**
- Connect sections
- Use reader dialogue
- Vary section lengths

**New focus:**
- DON'T follow clean narrative arc
- Jump between topics mid-explanation
- Plant seeds early, pay off later
- Circle back naturally
- Digress without always advancing the point

**Why this matters:**
The review identified that Iteration 7's structure was "too clean" - it followed a V1→V2→V3→V4 progression that felt pedagogical rather than exploratory. Human articles have messier structure with:
- Topic jumps: "ここで、〜を離れて〜に移ります"
- Admitted digressions: "余談だが", "話が逸れるが"
- Callbacks: "さて、先ほどの〇〇の話に戻ると"

### 4. Enhanced Section 5.6: "Vary Assertion Strength Dramatically" [MAJOR REVISION]

**Lines removed:** ~15 lines (old "Strong Assertions")
**Lines added:** ~15 lines (new "Vary Assertion Strength")
**Net change:** 0 lines

**What changed:**
Shifted from "don't hedge everything" to "use FULL SPECTRUM of certainty levels."

**New guidance includes 6 levels of certainty:**
1. **Definitive** (proven facts): "useRefは再レンダリングを引き起こさない"
2. **Strong opinion**: "これは間違いです"
3. **Reasoned inference**: "〜と考えられます" (with evidence)
4. **Speculation**: "〜かもしれない", "〜だろうか"
5. **Tentative exploration**: "〜という気がする"
6. **Admitted ignorance**: "実装を確認していないので推測ですが"

**Why this matters:**
The review noted "assertion strength still too uniform." The old guidance said "mix strong and weak," but didn't explain the nuance. Human articles show genuine uncertainty curves - confident where they know, tentative where they don't, speculative where they're exploring.

### 5. Condensed Section 5.4: "Technical Depth" [COMPRESSION]

**Lines removed:** ~8 lines
**Lines added:** ~6 lines
**Net change:** -2 lines

**What changed:**
Compressed examples and explanations without losing core message.

**Kept:**
- "Go deep on why/how, not just what"
- Depth indicators
- GitHub reference guidance

**Removed:**
- Redundant examples
- Verbose explanations

### 6. Updated Section 5.2: "Tone & Voice" [COMPRESSION]

**Lines removed:** ~8 lines
**Lines added:** ~6 lines
**Net change:** -2 lines

**What changed:**
Removed redundant teaching transition examples, kept core principle.

**Rationale:**
With the new meta-cognitive section 5.1 emphasizing thinking over formulas, we don't need as many specific examples of what to avoid. The Writer should understand WHY pedagogical scaffolding is bad (it's teaching, not thinking).

### 7. Completely Revised ANTI-PATTERNS Section [MAJOR REVISION]

**Lines removed:** ~12 lines
**Lines added:** ~10 lines
**Net change:** -2 lines

**What changed:**
Prioritized meta-issues over specific patterns.

**New top items:**
1. **FORMULA-FOLLOWING** (new, in bold)
2. Uniform depth (elevated importance)
3. Clean structure (elevated importance)
4. No conceptual frameworks (new)
5. Uniform assertions (elevated importance)

**Why this matters:**
The anti-patterns now reflect the THINKING problems that lead to AI tells, not just the surface symptoms. This helps the Writer understand the root causes.

## Net Line Changes

**Lines added:** ~75 (new content)
**Lines removed:** ~68 (compression and consolidation)
**Net change:** +7 lines
**New total:** 355 lines (target: <350, slightly over but justified)

**Justification for exceeding target:**
The new meta-cognitive guidance (Section 5.1) and conceptual frameworks (Section 5.3) are CRITICAL for breaking through the 8.0/10 plateau. These ~38 lines address the root cause of formula-following. We compressed elsewhere (-10 lines total from other sections) to minimize growth.

## Sections Consolidated or Compressed

1. **Section 5.2 (Tone & Voice):** Removed 2 redundant teaching transition examples
2. **Section 5.4 (Technical Depth):** Compressed examples from 2 to 1, simplified explanations
3. **Section 5.5 (Structure):** Completely restructured to be more concise and focused
4. **ANTI-PATTERNS:** Removed redundant items, prioritized meta-issues

## Rule Effectiveness Tracking

### Rules That Worked (Keep, Already Compressed)

- **[✓ EFFECTIVE - Followed]** Trial-and-Error Progression (Section 5.2)
  - Evidence: "最初の実装 → 無限ループ → Promiseをキャッシュ → レースコンディション → 結果もキャッシュ → エラーもキャッシュ"
  - Action: Keep as-is, already compressed in current guide

- **[✓ EFFECTIVE - Followed]** Reader Dialogue (Section 5.5)
  - Evidence: "お察しの通り", "皆さんならどうしますか", "これを見て『なんで？』と思った方"
  - Action: Keep as-is, moved to compressed mention in new structure section

- **[✓ EFFECTIVE - Followed]** Personal Anecdotes (Section 5.3)
  - Evidence: "去年、社内のダッシュボード（5画面くらい）をリファクタリングしたんですけど"
  - Action: Keep as-is, working well

- **[✓ EFFECTIVE - Followed]** Technical Accuracy (§1.3)
  - Evidence: Accurate explanations of Suspense mechanics, Promise throwing, race conditions
  - Action: No changes needed

### Rules That Were Followed Too Mechanically (META-ISSUE)

- **[~ MECHANICAL]** All Advanced Techniques
  - Evidence: Trial-and-error, reader dialogue, anecdotes ALL present but feel formulaic
  - Impact: Article scores 8.0/10 but reads as "following a formula"
  - Action: **Created new Section 5.1 to address root cause** - emphasize thinking over formula-following

### New Issues Not Covered by Current Guide

- **[+ NEW ISSUE]** Lack of Conceptual Frameworks
  - Evidence: Article explains HOW Suspense works but doesn't introduce meta-technical concepts like "Promise一級市民化" or "レンダリング単位の記憶領域"
  - Impact: Feels like reporting rather than thinking
  - Proposed guideline: **Created new Section 5.3** with examples and how-to

- **[+ NEW ISSUE]** Structure Too Clean/Linear
  - Evidence: Clean V1→V2→V3→V4 progression without digressions, backtracking, or topic jumps
  - Impact: Feels pedagogical rather than exploratory
  - Proposed guideline: **Restructured Section 5.5** to emphasize non-linear exploration

- **[+ NEW ISSUE]** Uniform Assertion Strength
  - Evidence: Most claims are at same confidence level (reasoned inference)
  - Impact: Missing the variety of human thinking (definitive facts, speculation, admitted ignorance)
  - Proposed guideline: **Enhanced Section 5.6** with 6 levels of certainty

- **[+ NEW ISSUE]** Depth Variation Still Too Consistent
  - Evidence: Sections are 3-5 paragraphs each; no dramatic variation (1 sentence vs 15 paragraphs)
  - Impact: Feels templated
  - Proposed guideline: **Added to Section 5.2** - "Some topics: 1 sentence. Others: 10+ paragraphs."

## Expected Impact

This update represents a **paradigm shift** from prescriptive rules to meta-cognitive guidance.

### What Should Change in Next Iteration:

1. **Less mechanical application** - Techniques emerge naturally from thinking
2. **More conceptual frameworks** - Meta-technical concepts that reframe discussions
3. **Messier structure** - Non-linear exploration with digressions and callbacks
4. **Varied assertion strength** - Full spectrum from definitive to speculative
5. **Dramatic depth variation** - Some topics 1 sentence, others 15 paragraphs

### Success Metrics:

- **Quality score > 8.0/10** (breaking the plateau)
- **Reviewer notes "feels organic"** rather than "following a formula"
- **Presence of original conceptual frameworks** not found in source material
- **Structural messiness** - admitted digressions, topic jumps, callbacks
- **Visible certainty variation** - mix of definitive, speculative, and admitted ignorance

## Version History

- **v1.0** (Iterations 1-2): Basic structure, format, tone
- **v2.0** (Iterations 3-5): Added authenticity markers, anecdotes, depth guidance
- **v2.1** (Iteration 5): Added trial-and-error process
- **v2.2** (Iteration 6): Added reader dialogue
- **v3.0** (Iteration 7): **META-SHIFT: From formula-following to thinking-driven writing**

## Critical Insight for Future Iterations

**The style guide cannot make the Writer think.** It can only describe what human thinking looks like when written down. The addition of Section 5.1 is an attempt to point the Writer toward genuine cognitive processes rather than surface-level pattern matching.

If Iteration 8 still feels mechanical, we may need to fundamentally reconsider whether prescriptive guidelines can ever produce organic writing, or whether we need a different approach entirely (e.g., few-shot learning with human examples, or more emphasis on the Writer's "internal monologue" during generation).

This is the critical test: **Can explicit meta-cognitive guidance break through the formula-following plateau?**
