## Major Additions

### 1. Personal Voice Guidelines
Added extensive guidance on using first-person perspective:
- Using "筆者は", "個人的には", "自分は" patterns
- Sharing personal experiences and opinions
- Including subjective judgments and feelings
- Balancing objective technical content with personal perspective

### 2. Technical Depth Requirements
Emphasized the importance of deep technical content:
- PR/issue references with specific numbers and author names
- Version history and historical context
- Design decisions and "why" explanations
- Implementation details when relevant
- Clear differentiation between facts, interpretations, and opinions

### 3. Natural Tone Patterns
Detailed what conversational Japanese sounds like:
- Conversational connectors vs formulaic transitions
- Varying sentence structure naturally
- Rhetorical pauses and thinking-out-loud moments
- Casual interjections like "さて", "ところで", "そう", "なお"

### 4. Structural Flexibility
Broke away from rigid textbook patterns:
- Multiple organization strategies (problem-first, historical, comparative, discovery-based)
- Varied introduction styles beyond standard greetings
- Enhanced まとめ sections with insights beyond recap
- Natural flow over predictable structure

### 5. AI Pattern Avoidance (New Section)
Created explicit examples of patterns to avoid:

- **Detail Issues**: Incorrect references, overused adjectives

### 6. Authenticity Markers
Added requirements for human-like writing:

Reorganized and expanded checklist to 21 items across 5 categories:
- Format and Structure (4 items)

- Details (4 items)

### 8. Human vs AI Examples (New Section)
Added side-by-side comparisons showing:
